🎓 Student Pass / Fail Prediction using Decision Tree

Python Developer • Machine Learning • Explainable AI • Streamlit

An interactive Streamlit web application that predicts whether a student will PASS or FAIL based on daily study hours using a Decision Tree classifier.

This project demonstrates an explainable machine learning workflow, combining real-time prediction, confidence scoring, and interpretable model visualization.
